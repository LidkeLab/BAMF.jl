# BAMF Documentation

This repository is currently serving as a vehicle to explore the Julia Language environment using a somewhat sophisticated code base. It implements the core Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm from the paper:


*Bayesian Multiple Emitter Fitting using Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo.*  
Mohamadreza Fazel, Michael J. Wester, Hanieh Mazloom-Farsibaf, Marjolein B. M. Meddens, Alexandra S. Eklund, Thomas Schlichthaerle, Florian Schueder, Ralf Jungmann & Keith A. Lidke. Scientific Reports, 2019. 9(1): p. 13791.  

Documentation is rudimentary and should be considered only as proof of principle of the autodoc system at this stage.
